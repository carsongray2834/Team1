**Team Members:** 

I am doing the particle class
  - Carson Gray
    
      My idea is particles swirling together into a central point then either getting deleted or ejected.

I am doing the linked list class
  - Jackson Douglass

    My idea is grass blowing in the wind or a waterfall and a flowing river

I am doing the graphics class.
  - Lucas Riley
    
    My idea is a light swinging and showering down sparks every so often.

Particle system class
  - Gurshan Singh

    My idea is to make a little faucet that drips water on mouse click and it will explode after a few clicks.  

NOTES:
For drawing shapes and measuring scale: remember that width increases half as fast as height. drawRect(row,column, 20, 10) will draw a square. drawOval(center row, center column, 20, 10) will draw a circle.
